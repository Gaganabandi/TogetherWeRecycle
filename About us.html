<p style="text-align:center;line-height: 150%;color: brown;">At Together We Recycle, we believe that small actions can lead to big changes.<br> Our mission is to reduce plastic pollution by making it easy for people to dispose of their plastic waste responsibly.<br> Through our platform, registered members can schedule plastic pickups or drop-offs, and we ensure that all collected waste is properly recycled.<br>

We aim to build a community that cares for the environment and takes action. <br>By working together, we’re not just managing waste—we’re creating a cleaner, greener future.

Let’s recycle. Let’s do it togetther.</p>
